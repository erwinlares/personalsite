<p>One of the things I found most challenging about multisyllabic words in English is that you don’t really pronounce most of the vowels except for the vowel in the stressed syllable; the rest are just unstressed central vocoids or schwas.</p>
<p>By contrast, in Spanish, we distinctively articulate each vowel regardless of its stress status … or so I thought. Martinez Celdrán and Fernárndez Planas (2007:88) report that “all vowels are somewhat centralized when unstressed, with respect to the more peripheral position in the vowel space they occupy when stressed” … sounds very schwa-y to me …</p>
<p>Does that mean that in 200 years we would be like English? 😱😱😱</p>
