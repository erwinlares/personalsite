# Linguistic trivia

One of the things I found most challenging about multisyllabic words in English is that you don't really pronounce most of the vowels except for the vowel in the stressed syllable; the rest are just unstressed central vocoids or schwas. 

By contrast, in Spanish, we distinctively articulate each vowel regardless of its stress status ... or so I thought.  Martinez CeldrÃ¡n and FernÃ¡rndez Planas (2007:88) report that "all vowels are somewhat centralized when unstressed, with respect to the more peripheral position in the vowel space they occupy when stressed" . 

Does that mean that in 200 years we would be like English? ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±
